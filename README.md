# Instill AI Protobufs

This repository is a fork of
[instill-ai/protobufs](https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/) that serves as
a playground for developing a GitHub action that syncs the public API reference,
hosted in [ReadMe](https://openapi.instill.tech/), with the [Instill
Core](https://github.com/instill-ai/core).


## Current status

There are 3 public OpenAPI references (Core, Model and VDP), which version
points to the latest Instill Core version (perhaps model should have a different
release version.

Every time a new Instill Core release is published, a [GitHub
action](https://github.com/instill-ai/core/actions/workflows/sync-version-with-api-docs.yml)
creates a PR updating the version in the OpenAPI documents. Once this is merged,
we have to manually re-sync the public documentation.

üéâ Changes were merged in https://github.com/instill-ai/protobufs/pull/270

## Goals

- Having a private version of the API references that we can keep in sync with
  the `main` branch in the `protobufs` repo in order to QA the documentation
  before syncing the public version.
- Syncing the public version automatically when the version update PR is merged.

## ‚úÖ Step 1: with a single public and private version

- On `main` branch merge: update staging docs
- On version PR merge: update production docs

### ReadMe setup

2 versions per (major) Core release: public and private.

![ReadMe versions](https://github.com/jvallesm/instill-protobufs/assets/3977183/e7c5aa6e-52db-498e-a27c-7fa1506dc089)

As we have 3 docs per version, we can either keep the IDs as variables in our
workflow or obtain them from the ReadMe API.

## ‚úÖ Step 2: one public version per release + a staging version for the next release.

- On `main` branch merge: update staging docs
- On version PR merge: create new (main, beta, public) version with staging one
  as base.

### ReadMe setup

- 1 public version per Core release.
- 1 private version per major Core release.

![ReadMe versions](https://github.com/jvallesm/instill-protobufs/assets/3977183/e17e4a00-fbbb-4288-88ed-aafe670287ac)

We can keep the private API IDs constant, then create new main versions from
them as releases occur.

## ‚úÖ Step 2.1: back to single versions

ReadMe limits the number of versions a subscription plan can have, so adding a
new version each release cycle does not scale. We'll go back to one public
version and a private one. The name of the private version will point to the
latest Core release and if we need to support several major versions we can have
different endpoint collections (e.g. `VDP v2`) within the same version.

### ReadMe setup

- 1 public version e.g. v0.12.0-beta (version will point to Core release)
- 1 staging version v0-beta-staging (we might change the name when Core is at
    1.x.x but we shouldn't create a new version. The IDs of this version will be
    tied to the workflow).

![ReadMe versions](https://github.com/jvallesm/instill-protobufs/assets/3977183/5039d2df-4d62-4560-b317-d352b6e5d17a)
![ReadMe versions](https://github.com/jvallesm/instill-protobufs/assets/3977183/050fcb61-b112-4d52-af1b-77d812fae087)

We'll keep the private API IDs constant, then create new main versions from
them as releases occur.

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Additional feature: display diff on version update PR

- On version PR merge: create tag with version
- On Core GitHub action PR: generate link with diff.
